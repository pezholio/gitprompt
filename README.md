#What the hell is this?

Super-awesome bash prompt with rbenv and Git stuff in it. Based off a Gist I found ages ago (and can no longer track down) which stopped working properly when I 'upgraded' to Mavericks

#Usage

Something like 

    . ~/path_where_you_cloned_it/gitprompt/gitprompt
    
in your `.bashrc` or whatever

#Bugs

Yes, for sure. It's 60 lines of bash
